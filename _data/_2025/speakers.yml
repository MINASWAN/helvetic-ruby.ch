  biography: |
    Less of a Renaissance Developer than a Code Grognard, Ronan has been writing software for more than 25 years. Thankfully, most of them were spent in Ruby land, and that is the secret to his youthful enthusiasm and baffling immaturity.

    When he's not giving his poor coworkers lectures on the importance of making right and not just making it work, Ronan enjoys complaining about TailwindCSS or TypeScript on social media. And also playing tabletop RPGs. And heavy metal.

  biography: |
    Based in Vancouver, Canada, Kyle is a jack of all trades and a master of some; at least he thinks so. He works as a software developer readily turning abstract ideas into working pieces of software. He has been focused recently on new tools for developers and helping others excel in their career. When not developing, he enjoys amazing food and craft breweries of the west coast, as well as picking up really heavy objects just so they can be put back down.

  title: "More feedback! Quantity becomes quality"
  abstract: |
    Can someone write a large quantity of high-quality code? Yes! The idea that speed sacrifices quality is a myth. The key lies in gathering ample feedbackâ€”both internal and external. Shifting focus to feedback quantity, while still prioritizing quality, enables consistent high-quality code. This talk explores supporting research and practical ways to gather feedback effectively.
