    <h3>Arrival from abroad</h3>

    <p>If your only option is air travel, Geneva Airport (GVA) is the closest airport.</p>

    <p>Check out the <a href="https://www.geneve.com/en/">Geneva tourism website</a> if this is your first time here.</p>

    <h4>About Switzerland</h4>

    <p>Here are some useful and less useful facts about Switzerland.</p>

    <dl class="trivia">
      <dt>Language</dt>
      <dd>Official languages are German, French, Italian and Romansh. In cities most people will understand and speak English.</dd>

      <dt>Money</dt>
      <dd>We love money, we use Swiss Francs (CHF). Euro (EUR) may be accepted in some places. Cashless payment methods are widely accepted.</dd>

      <dt>Tipping</dt>
      <dd>Tipping is not compulsory. Feel free to tip (5% - 10%) if you're happy with the service though.</dd>

      <dt>Transportation</dt>
      <dd>We drive on the right side of the road.</dd>

      <dt>Public transportation</dt>
      <dd>We have one of the most efficient, extensive and probably expensive public transportation systems in the world.</dd>

      <dt>Electricity</dt>
      <dd>We use the Type C and Type J outlets. Voltage is 230V and the electrical frequency is 50Hz.</dd>

      <dt>Emergency</dt>
      <dd>Dial 112 for any kind of emergency.</dd>

      <dt>Water</dt>
      <dd>Switzerland has high-quality tap water, there's no actual need to buy bottled water. You can also drink the water from all public fountains unless there is a sign not to (you won't find many of these).</dd>

      <dt>Stores</dt>
      <dd>Many shops in Switzerland remain closed on Sundays, except for some in railway stations and airports.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Arrival from Switzerland</h3>
    <p>Please use public transport.</p>
    <p>The venue is next to the main Geneva railway station (Gen√®ve-Cornavin).</p>

    <h2 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h2>
