          <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
          <p>
            Our goal is to maintain an inclusive, safe, helpful, and friendly community for
            everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual
            orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
            religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.
          </p>

          <p>
            This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring
            outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues — online and
            in-person — as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such
            behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of
            community members.
          </p>

          <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Be welcoming.</li>
            <li>Be kind.</li>
            <li>Look out for each other.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Conduct or speech which is sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist,
              or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature. This may include:
              <ul>
                <li>Unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory, or inappropriate nicknames or terms.</li>
                <li>Disrespectful jokes, innuendo, or dismissive language and attitude.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Intimidation or harassment (online or in-person).</li>
            <li>Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect
              others. If you are making someone uncomfortable, stop.</li>

            <li>Violence, threats of violence, or violent language.</li>
            <li>Other disruptive or unsafe behavior.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Enforcement</h2>

          <p>
